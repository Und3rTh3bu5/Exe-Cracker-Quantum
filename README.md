# Exe-Cracker-Quantum
A program that uses Grover's Algorithm with a simple phase oracle and Quantum superposition to crack an 8-bit encrypted exe file. This program is designed for quantum computers.

#The math behind the algorithm:
The number of iterations is calculated with the formula:
$N_i$ = $\frac{\frac{\pi}{4}}{arcsin(\frac{1}{\sqrt(1<<N)})-0.5}$
