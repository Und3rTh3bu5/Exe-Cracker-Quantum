# Exe-Cracker-Quantum
A program that uses Grover's Algorithm with a simple phase oracle and Quantum superposition to crack an 8-bit encrypted exe file. This program is designed for quantum computers.

# The Math
Many algorithms, especially those in quantum computing, involve a lot of math. 

The first step is to calculate the number of optimal iterations for the main loop using the formula:
$$\left(\sum_{k=1}^n k \right)$$
